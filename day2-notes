operators' 
==========

	Ø What is operators 
	Ø Operator in python are special 

Examples 
A = 10
B = 20
C = a+b


Conditional Statements 
======================

	Ø Conditional statements allow a program to make decisions  based on conditions 
	Ø The program executes different blocks of code depending on whether a condition is True or False 

Real time analogy
=================

	Ø If it rains >> take umbrella 
	Ø Else  >> don’t take umbrella


Why do we need conditional statements?
======================================

	Ø Control the flow of execution 
	Ø implement decision-making logic
	Ø Validate user input
	Ø Apply business rules
	Ø Build real-world app's

Types of conditional
====================

	1. If
	2. If else
	3. If elif else


	1. If
=======

	Ø It will execute code only if the condition is true


age = 20
if age >= 18:
  print("you are an adult")
  print("you can vote")
  print("you have full legal rights")



number = 15
if number > 0:
  print("the number is positive")


	2. If else 
============

	Ø  it will execute one block if condition is true, otherwise it will execute else block


a = 200
b = 33
if b > a:
  print("b is greater than a")
else:
  print("b is not great than a")



number  = 7
if number % 2 == 0:
  print("the number is even")
else:
  print ("the number is add")


	3. If elif else
=================

	Ø It will use for when multiple conditions need to be checked


score = 75
if score >= 90:
  print ("Grade A")
elif score >= 80:
  print ("Grade B")
elif score >= 70:
  print ("Grade C")
elif score >= 60:
  print ("Grade D")


a = 33
b = 33
if b > a:
  print("b is greater than a")
elif a == b:
  print("a and b are equal")


Loops
=====

	Ø A  loop in python is a control statement  used to execute a block of code repeatedly until a condition is satisfied  or for each  item in a sequence 
	Ø Loops are helping us to avoid writing same code again and again.

	1. For loop
	2. While loop


	1. For loop
=============

	Ø A for loop is used to iterate over a sequence 


fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for x in fruits:
  print(x)


for i in range (1, 6):
  print(i)
